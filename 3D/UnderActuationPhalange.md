1. Visualization Analysis:
   - The design uses a cascading three-phalange system with decreasing segment sizes
   - Each joint is controlled by a bell crank mechanism
   - The linkages create an underactuated system where moving the proximal joint influences the other joints
   - The tapered design mimics natural finger proportions

2. Potential Improvements:
    Mechanical:
    - Consider adding mechanical stops to prevent over-rotation
      - The bell crank thickness (3mm) might be thin for high loads - could be increased to 4-5mm
      - Add fillets at stress concentration points, especially around pin joints
      - Consider adding bearing surfaces around pin joints for reduced wear
    
    Design Parameters:
    - The proximal_phalange_width (15mm) seems wide compared to length - could be reduced to 12-13mm for more natural proportions
      - The pin_radius (1mm) might be undersized for the loads - consider 1.5-2mm
      - Add clearance values as parameters for easier adjustment of fit tolerances
    
    Manufacturing Considerations:
    - Add assembly guides or alignment features
      - Include mounting points for sensors if needed
      - Consider splitting larger pieces for easier printing
      - Add channels for cable routing if using tendon actuation

3. Technical Analysis:

    Range of Motion:
    - Current bell crank angles (-45° to 45°) provide approximately 90° total range
      - The cascading effect means distal joints can move further:
        * Proximal joint: ~90° rotation
        * Middle joint: ~100° potential rotation
        * Distal joint: ~110° potential rotation
    
    Mechanical Advantage:
    - The bell crank size (8mm) creates a mechanical advantage of approximately:
      * Primary joint: 1:3.75 (based on 30mm phalange length)
      * Middle joint: 1:2.81 (based on 22.5mm length)
      * Distal joint: 1:1.87 (based on 15mm length)
    
    Force Distribution:
    - The tapering design helps distribute forces more evenly
      - The bell crank system provides progressive resistance
      - Estimated force requirements (assuming typical grip strength):
        * Proximal joint: ~2.5N
        * Middle joint: ~1.8N
        * Distal joint: ~1.2N
