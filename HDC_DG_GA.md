# Integrating Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) and Dynamic Graphs with Geometric Algebra

## Abstract
Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) and Dynamic Graphs (DGs) represent promising paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in domains requiring adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency. Geometric Algebra (GA), a mathematical framework for representing geometric transformations and multi-dimensional data, offers a unique foundation to unify and enhance these paradigms. This paper explores how GA can be used to encode and manipulate high-dimensional data in HDC and optimize evolving structures in DGs, emphasizing the potential for robust, scalable, and biologically inspired AI systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Limitations of Neural Networks
Neural networks dominate AI research, yet they face inherent challenges, including static topologies, high computational costs, and limited real-time adaptability. To surpass these limitations, novel approaches like HDC and DGs have emerged, prioritizing robustness and efficiency over massive parameterization.

### 1.2 Why Geometric Algebra?
Geometric Algebra provides a rich framework for representing and manipulating multi-dimensional geometric objects. By integrating GA with HDC and DGs, we can:
- Encode data in a spatially meaningful and compact manner.
- Perform transformations and operations that preserve geometric and structural properties.
- Enhance robustness and interpretability.

## 2. Geometric Algebra Fundamentals

### 2.1 Key Concepts
1. **Multivectors**:
   - Extend scalars, vectors, and higher-order constructs in a unified framework.
   - Example: In a 3D space, a multivector $M$ might contain scalars, vectors, bivectors (planes), and trivectors (volumes).

2. **Operations**:
   - **Outer Product** ($\wedge$): Encodes higher-dimensional entities (e.g., bivectors).
   - **Inner Product** ($\cdot$): Projects entities onto one another.
   - **Geometric Product**: Combines both inner and outer products, forming a foundation for encoding and transformations.

3. **Rotations and Transformations**:
   - Rotors (special bivectors) represent rotations in multi-dimensional spaces.
   - Transformation example: Rotate vector $v$ by rotor $R$: $v' = R v \tilde{R}$.

## 3. Hyperdimensional Computing with Geometric Algebra

### 3.1 Encoding with Multivectors
HDC typically uses high-dimensional vectors to represent data. Using GA, these vectors can be replaced with multivectors, enabling:
- **Compact Encoding**: Scalars, vectors, and higher-order relationships coexist in the same entity.
- **Spatial Interpretability**: Relationships between features are encoded geometrically.

#### Example: Encoding Sensor Data
Consider a robot with sensors measuring temperature ($T$), distance ($d$), and angle ($\theta$):

```math
M = T + d e_1 + \theta e_{1} \wedge e_{2}
```

- Scalar $T$: Temperature.
- Vector $d e_1$: Distance in direction $e_1$.
- Bivector $\theta e_{1} \wedge e_{2}$: Angular information in the plane $e_{1}, e_{2}$.

### 3.2 Operations in GA-Enhanced HDC

1. **Bundling** (Superposition):
   Combine data streams:
```math
   M_{combined} = M_1 + M_2.
```

2. **Binding** (Association):
   Use the geometric product to bind entities:
   \[
   M_{bound} = M_1 M_2.
   \]

3. **Similarity**:
   Measure similarity using inner products or projections:
```math
   \text{Similarity}(M_1, M_2) = \langle M_1 \cdot M_2 \rangle_0,
```
   where $\langle \cdot \rangle_0$ extracts the scalar part.

### 3.3 Advantages
- **Error Tolerance**: High-dimensional encoding inherently resists noise.
- **Interpretability**: Geometric relationships are explicitly encoded.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Multivector operations can be parallelized on neuromorphic chips.

## 4. Dynamic Graphs with Geometric Algebra

### 4.1 Graph Representation
Graphs $G(V, E)$ can naturally leverage GA:
- **Nodes (Vertices)**: Represented as points in a multi-dimensional space.
- **Edges**: Encoded as vectors or bivectors, representing relationships or transformations.

#### Example: Encoding Edge Weights
For nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$, an edge $e_{ij}$ with weight $w$ can be represented as:
```math
E_{ij} = w (v_j - v_i) e_1.
```

### 4.2 Dynamic Graph Updates
Using GA, edge weights and node positions can evolve under transformations:

1. **Edge Weight Adjustment**:
   Update edge weights $w_{ij}$ based on feedback $\Delta w$:
```math
   w_{ij}^{t+1} = w_{ij}^t + \alpha \Delta w_{ij}.
```

2. **Node State Evolution**:
   Represent node state updates as geometric transformations:
```math
   v_i^{t+1} = R v_i^t \tilde{R} + \Delta v.
```

### 4.3 Pathfinding and Optimization
- **Laplacian Dynamics**:
   Use the graph Laplacian $L = D - A$ to compute diffusion or optimize flows.
   In GA, node states evolve via:
```math
   \frac{d v}{dt} = -L v.
```

- **Energy Minimization**:
   Model edge adjustments as minimizing a potential energy:
```math
   E = \sum_{i,j} w_{ij}^2.
```

### 4.4 Advantages
- **Dynamic Topologies**: Encode evolving graphs geometrically.
- **Multi-Scale Representation**: Capture local and global features using GA constructs like bivectors.
- **Efficient Computation**: Leverage GA operations for pathfinding and optimization.
