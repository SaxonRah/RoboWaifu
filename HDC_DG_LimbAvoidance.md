# **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)** and **Dynamic Graphs** 
Robotics applications like limb movement and object avoidance offers exciting possibilities for efficient, robust, and adaptable systems. 

---

## **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) in Robotics**

### 1. **Limb Movement Control**
HDC encodes high-dimensional representations of sensor data, motor signals, and environmental feedback to make decisions for movement.

#### **Concept: Encoding Limb State**
- **State Representation**:
  - Encode joint angles, velocities, and forces as a single hypervector.
  - Example: A robotic arm with 6 joints could have a hypervector representation combining these features.
  - `state_vector = joint_angles ⊕ joint_velocities ⊕ forces`.

- **Motor Command Generation**:
  - Use hypervectors to map states to optimal motor commands.
  - `motor_command = f(state_vector)` where `f` is an associative memory lookup or a simple operation in hyperdimensional space.

#### **Benefits**:
- **Robustness**: High-dimensional encoding tolerates noise from sensors.
- **Efficiency**: Operations like addition and multiplication are computationally lightweight compared to matrix operations in neural networks.

#### **Example Code: Joint Encoding in HDC**
```python
import numpy as np

def encode_joint_state(joint_angles, joint_velocities, forces, dim=10000):
    """Encode robotic limb state into a hypervector."""
    angles_vector = np.random.permutation(np.random.randn(dim)) * np.mean(joint_angles)
    velocities_vector = np.random.permutation(np.random.randn(dim)) * np.mean(joint_velocities)
    forces_vector = np.random.permutation(np.random.randn(dim)) * np.mean(forces)
    return angles_vector + velocities_vector + forces_vector

# Example state encoding
joint_angles = [30, 45, 60]
joint_velocities = [1.5, 0.5, -0.8]
forces = [10, 15, 5]
state_vector = encode_joint_state(joint_angles, joint_velocities, forces)
print(f"Encoded state vector: {state_vector[:10]}...")  # Print first 10 elements
```

---

### 2. **Object Avoidance**
HDC can encode spatial information from sensors like LiDAR or cameras to detect obstacles and plan movements.

#### **Concept: Encoding Spatial Awareness**
- **Environment Encoding**:
  - Encode distances and angles of obstacles detected by sensors.
  - `obstacle_vector = f(distance) ⊗ g(angle)`, where `⊗` is a binding operation.

- **Collision Avoidance**:
  - Compute similarity between current state and known safe states.
  - Adjust trajectory by minimizing similarity to obstacle-encoded hypervectors.

#### **Example Code: Obstacle Avoidance Encoding**
```python
def encode_obstacle(distance, angle, dim=10000):
    """Encode obstacle information into a hypervector."""
    distance_vector = np.random.permutation(np.random.randn(dim)) * (1 / distance)
    angle_vector = np.random.permutation(np.random.randn(dim)) * np.sin(angle)
    return distance_vector * angle_vector

# Example obstacle encoding
distance = 2.0  # meters
angle = np.pi / 4  # radians
obstacle_vector = encode_obstacle(distance, angle)
print(f"Encoded obstacle vector: {obstacle_vector[:10]}...")
```

## **Dynamic Graphs in Robotics**

### 1. **Adaptive Limb Coordination**
Dynamic graphs represent the limb as nodes and joints as edges, allowing for real-time adaptation of movement strategies.

#### **Graph-Based Limb Representation**:
- **Nodes**: Represent sensors, actuators, or parts of the limb (e.g., elbow, wrist).
- **Edges**: Represent connections (e.g., joint flexibility or torque limits).

#### **Dynamic Edge Weights**:
- Update weights based on sensor feedback (e.g., torque, position).
- Example: Decrease weight of edges for joints near their torque limit to prioritize safer paths.

#### **Example Code: Dynamic Graph Limb Model**
```python
import numpy as np

def update_limb_graph(graph, feedback, alpha=0.1):
    """Update limb graph weights based on feedback."""
    for edge in graph['edges']:
        i, j = edge['nodes']
        feedback_strength = feedback.get((i, j), 0)
        edge['weight'] -= alpha * feedback_strength
    return graph

# Example graph
limb_graph = {
    'nodes': ['shoulder', 'elbow', 'wrist'],
    'edges': [
        {'nodes': ('shoulder', 'elbow'), 'weight': 1.0},
        {'nodes': ('elbow', 'wrist'), 'weight': 1.0},
    ],
}

# Simulated feedback
feedback = {('shoulder', 'elbow'): 0.2, ('elbow', 'wrist'): -0.1}
updated_graph = update_limb_graph(limb_graph, feedback)
print(updated_graph)
```

---

### 2. **Dynamic Graph for Object Avoidance**
Represent the environment as a graph, where:
- **Nodes**: Represent the robot and obstacles.
- **Edges**: Represent possible paths.

#### **Dynamic Path Planning**:
- Update edge weights based on sensor data (e.g., increase weights for paths near obstacles).
- Use graph search algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra’s or A*) to find the safest path.

#### **Example Code: Dynamic Path Planning**
```python
import networkx as nx

def update_path_weights(graph, obstacle_positions, robot_position, alpha=0.1):
    """Update path weights based on proximity to obstacles."""
    for edge in graph.edges:
        node1, node2 = edge
        midpoint = (np.array(node1) + np.array(node2)) / 2
        min_distance = min(np.linalg.norm(midpoint - obs) for obs in obstacle_positions)
        graph[node1][node2]['weight'] += alpha / min_distance
    return graph

# Example graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edge((0, 0), (1, 0), weight=1.0)
G.add_edge((1, 0), (1, 1), weight=1.0)
G.add_edge((0, 0), (0, 1), weight=1.0)

# Simulated obstacle positions
obstacles = [np.array([0.5, 0.5])]

# Update weights
updated_G = update_path_weights(G, obstacles, robot_position=(0, 0))
print("Updated edge weights:")
for edge in updated_G.edges(data=True):
    print(edge)
```

def encode_limb_state(joint_angles, joint_velocities, forces, dim=10000):
    """Encode limb state into a hypervector."""
    angles_vector = np.random.permutation(np.random.randn(dim)) * np.mean(joint_angles)
    velocities_vector = np.random.permutation(np.random.randn(dim)) * np.mean(joint_velocities)
    forces_vector = np.random.permutation(np.random.randn(dim)) * np.mean(forces)
    return angles_vector + velocities_vector + forces_vector

def encode_obstacle(distance, angle, dim=10000):

distance = 2.0  # meters
angle = np.pi / 4  # radians
obstacle_vector = encode_obstacle(distance, angle)
```

---

#### **B. Dynamic Graph Construction**
Create a dynamic graph for the limb and the environment.

```python

def create_limb_graph():
    """Create a graph representing the robot's limb."""
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edge("shoulder", "elbow", weight=1.0)
    G.add_edge("elbow", "wrist", weight=1.0)
    return G

def update_environment_graph(graph, obstacles, alpha=0.1):

print(f"Planned path: {path}")
```

---

        np.linalg.norm(current_state_vector) * np.linalg.norm(target_state_vector)
    )
    return similarity  # Use this as input for actuator control

    if (idx < dim) {
        float distance_val = 1.0 / distance;
        float angle_val = sin(angle);
        hypervector[idx] = distance_val * angle_val;
    }
}
```

endmodule
```

---

#### **Module 3: Pathfinding (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)**
Calculate shortest path in the graph.

**Verilog Implementation (High-Level)**:
```verilog
module dijkstra_pathfinding(
    input [31:0] adj_matrix [0:255][0:255],
    input [7:0] source_node,
    output reg [7:0] shortest_path [0:255]
);
    // Simplified Dijkstra's algorithm logic
    reg [31:0] distance [0:255];
    reg visited [0:255];
    integer i, j;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Initialize distances and visited nodes
        for (i = 0; i < 256; i = i + 1) begin
            distance[i] = 32'hFFFFFFFF;  // Max distance
            visited[i] = 0;
        end
        distance[source_node] = 0;

        // Perform shortest path computation
        for (j = 0; j < 256; j = j + 1) begin
            // Find the minimum distance node
            // Update distances for adjacent nodes
        end

        // Output shortest path
    end
endmodule
```
