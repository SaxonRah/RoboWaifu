### **1. HDC Encoder: Distance Preservation**
The `HDCEncoder` performs two main functions: encoding and operations (binding and bundling).

#### **Encoding:**
```math
  x_{\text{norm}} = \frac{x}{\|x\|_2} \quad \text{(normalization to unit vector)}
  h = \text{tanh}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\mathbf{P}^T x_{\text{norm}}\right)
```
- **Proof of distance preservation:** The random projection matrix $\mathbf{P}$ ensures that the dot product between two normalized vectors $x_{\text{norm}}$ and $y_{\text{norm}}$ in the high-dimensional space approximates their cosine similarity in the input space (Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma). The \(\tanh\) nonlinearity ensures bounded outputs while preserving relative distances.

---

#### **Binding:**
```math
  z = \text{IFFT}(\text{FFT}(a) \cdot \text{FFT}(b))
```
- **Proof of operation properties:**
  - Circular convolution approximates element-wise multiplication in the Fourier domain, which preserves orthogonality between unrelated hypervectors $a$ and $b$.
  - The result $z$ remains in the same dimensional space, ensuring consistency.

---

#### **Bundling:**
```math
  b = \text{tanh}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\right)
```
- **Proof of superposition property:** Summing vectors averages their components while keeping them bounded via \(\tanh\). The result approximates the centroid in high-dimensional space, preserving information from the inputs while maintaining distance properties.

### **2. Dynamic Graph: Convergent Weight Update**
The graph uses weights that are updated iteratively based on the similarity of features.

#### **Weight Update Rule:**
```math
  \text{sim}_{i,j} = \frac{\mathbf{f}_i \cdot \mathbf{f}_j}{\|\mathbf{f}_i\| \|\mathbf{f}_j\|} \quad \text{(cosine similarity, bounded in } [0, 1]\text{)}
  \nabla W_{i,j} = 2(W_{i,j} - \text{sim}_{i,j}) + 2\lambda W_{i,j}
  W_{i,j}^{\text{new}} = W_{i,j} - \alpha \nabla W_{i,j}
```
- **Convergence Proof:**
  - The update rule is a form of gradient descent on the cost function:
```math
  \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i,j} (W_{i,j} - \text{sim}_{i,j})^2 + \lambda \sum_{i,j} W_{i,j}^2
```
  - This is a convex function in $W_{i,j}$, so gradient descent converges to the global minimum.

### **3. Temporal Processor: Exponential Decay**
The temporal processor integrates features over time:
```math
  x_{\text{temp}}(t) = x + \sum_{t_i < t} e^{-\beta (t - t_i)} (x_i - x) \cdot (t - t_i)
```
- **Proof of temporal integration:**
  - The exponential decay term $e^{-\beta (t - t_i)}$ ensures older inputs contribute less to the result, following a memory decay model.
  - The difference $(x_i - x)$ captures temporal changes, integrated over time to provide a smooth temporal encoding.

---

### **4. Unified System: Laplacian Embedding**
The graph embedding uses the normalized Laplacian matrix:
```math
  \mathcal{L} = I - D^{-1/2} W D^{-1/2}
```
- **Spectral Properties:**
  - Eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}$ are non-negative, and the smallest eigenvalue is 0 (corresponding to the trivial eigenvector).
  - Non-trivial eigenvectors capture graph structure and node connectivity, enabling dimensionality reduction.

---

### **5. Combined Pipeline: Output Validity**
The output combines:
1. Temporal features ($x_{\text{temp}}$): High-dimensional, decayed over time.
2. Graph embeddings ($\text{Eigenvectors of } \mathcal{L}$): Captures structural features of the graph.

The concatenated output preserves both temporal and structural information while ensuring the dimensions match.

---

### **Conclusion**
The implementation is mathematically valid, leveraging well-established principles:
1. **HDC**: Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma for distance preservation.
2. **Graph Dynamics**: Gradient descent with convex regularization for weight convergence.
3. **Temporal Processing**: Exponential decay for temporal integration.
4. **Graph Embedding**: Spectral graph theory for structure preservation.
