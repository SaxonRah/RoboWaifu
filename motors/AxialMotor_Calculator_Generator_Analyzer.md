## 1. Magnetic Circuit Calculations:
- The code correctly implements two equivalent methods for calculating magnetic field strength
- The reluctance calculations properly account for both air gap and magnet reluctances
- The magnetic circuit analysis is mathematically sound

## 2. Torque Calculation Issues:
- The current torque calculation in AxialMotorCalculator uses a simplified model that may underestimate the actual torque
- It should include the effect of the number of pole pairs more explicitly
- The active length calculation could be more precise by considering the full arc length of the coil

## 3. Efficiency Calculation:
- The current implementation includes copper losses, core losses (3%), and mechanical losses (2%)
- However, it's missing:
  - Temperature effects on copper resistance
  - Eddy current losses
  - Detailed core loss calculation based on material properties
  - Speed-dependent losses

## 4. Missing Components:
- Thermal analysis is very basic - should include:
  - Temperature rise calculations
  - Cooling considerations
  - Thermal resistance modeling
- No demagnetization analysis for the permanent magnets
- No mechanical stress calculations for the rotor structure
- No detailed analysis of cogging torque

## 5. Parameter Validation:
- The geometry validation is good but could be more comprehensive
- Should add checks for:
  - Maximum speed limitations
  - Structural integrity at high speeds
  - Thermal limits

## 6. Optimization Opportunities:
- The current optimization approach is relatively simple
- Could benefit from:
  - Multi-objective optimization
  - Pareto frontier analysis
  - More sophisticated search algorithms
