## 1. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) Implementation

### HDCEncoder Class
The `HDCEncoder` class implements core HDC concepts from UCS:

```python
class HDCEncoder:
    def __init__(self, dim=1000, num_traits=4):
        self.dim = dim
        self.num_traits = num_traits
        self.projection = np.random.randn(num_traits, dim) / np.sqrt(num_traits)
```

Key UCS Features:
- Uses high-dimensional vectors (1000 dimensions) to encode species traits
- Implements projection matrix for robust distance-preserving encoding
- Includes similarity computations with caching for efficiency
- Follows UCS principles of robust, noise-resistant encoding

## 2. Dynamic Graph Implementation

### DynamicGraph Class
Implements UCS's dynamic graph concepts:

```python
class DynamicGraph:
    def __init__(self, decay_rate=0.1):
        self.weights = {}
        self.decay_rate = decay_rate
```

Key UCS Features:
- Maintains evolving relationships between species
- Implements temporal decay for dynamic adaptation
- Uses both spatial and trait-based similarity for edge weights
- Follows UCS principles of adaptive graph structures

## 3. Temporal Processing

### Temporal Integration
Implemented throughout the system:

1. In DynamicGraph:
```python
time_since_update = self.update_counter - self.last_update.get(edge, 0)
decay = np.exp(-self.decay_rate * time_since_update)
```

2. In EcosystemSimulation:
```python
self.time += 0.1  # Time progression
```

Key UCS Features:
- Exponential decay for temporal memory
- Time-based updates of relationships
- Integration of temporal information in decision making

## 4. Species Representation

### Species Class
Implements UCS's multi-dimensional representation:

```python
@dataclass
class Species:
    name: str
    position: Tuple[float, float]
    traits: np.ndarray  # HDC encoded traits
    energy: float
```

Key UCS Features:
- Combines spatial and trait information
- Uses HDC-encoded traits for robust representation
- Maintains state information for temporal processing

## 5. Movement and Decision Making

### Movement System
Implements UCS's decision-making framework:

```python
def update_movement(self, species_name: str, species: Species):
    # Forces include:
    # 1. Attraction to prey
    # 2. Repulsion from predators
    # 3. Boundary avoidance
    # 4. Random exploration
    # 5. Momentum
```

Key UCS Features:
- Uses graph weights for decision making
- Integrates multiple information sources
- Implements continuous, adaptive behavior
- Follows UCS principles of energy-based optimization

## 6. Environment Integration

### Environmental Factors
Implements UCS's contextual awareness:

```python
self.environment = {
    'temperature': 0.5,
    'resources': 1.0,
    'carrying_capacity': {
        'Grass': 50,
        'Rabbit': 30,
        'Fox': 15
    }
}
```

Key UCS Features:
- Maintains environmental context
- Influences species behavior and interactions
- Implements carrying capacity constraints

## 7. System Integration

### EcosystemSimulation Class
Integrates all UCS components:

```python
class EcosystemSimulation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.species = {}
        self.graph = DynamicGraph(decay_rate=0.05)
        self.time = 0.0
```

Key UCS Features:
- Combines HDC, dynamic graphs, and temporal processing
- Implements full UCS pipeline
- Maintains system-wide state and relationships

## 8. Performance and Optimization

1. Caching in HDC similarity computations
2. Selective graph updates
3. Efficient spatial calculations
4. Bounded movement and energy systems

## 9. Novel UCS Extensions

### Ecosystem-Specific Features:
1. Energy-based lifecycle management
2. Adaptive population control
3. Multi-species interactions
4. Environmental influence on behavior
