### 1. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)
The HDC component is implemented through the `HDCEncoder` class:

```python
class HDCEncoder:
    def __init__(self, dim: int):
        self.dimension = dim
        # Create projection matrix for converting 4D bird state to high-dimensional space
        self.projection = np.random.randn(4, dim) / np.sqrt(4)
        
    def encode(self, state: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        """Encode bird state into hypervector"""
        state_norm = state / (np.linalg.norm(state) + 1e-8)  # Normalize input
        hd_vector = np.tanh(state_norm @ self.projection)    # Project to high dimensions
        return hd_vector
```

This encoder:
- Takes a 4D bird state (x, y, dx, dy) and projects it into a 1000-dimensional space
- Uses normalized random projection matrix for distance preservation
- Applies tanh for non-linearity and bounded output
- State vectors are created in `get_state_vector`:
```python
def get_state_vector(self, bird: Bird) -> np.ndarray:
    return np.array([
        bird.position[0] / self.width,     # Normalized x position
        bird.position[1] / self.height,    # Normalized y position
        bird.velocity[0] / bird.max_speed, # Normalized x velocity
        bird.velocity[1] / bird.max_speed  # Normalized y velocity
    ])
```

### 2. Dynamic Graphs
The dynamic graph structure is implemented implicitly through neighbor relationships:

```python
def find_neighbors(self, bird: Bird, radius: float) -> List[Bird]:
    """Find neighboring birds within radius"""
    neighbors = []
    for other in self.birds:
        if other != bird:
            distance = np.linalg.norm(bird.position - other.position)
            if distance < radius:
                neighbors.append(other)
    return neighbors
```

Graph properties:
- Nodes: Individual birds
- Edges: Dynamic connections between birds within interaction radius
- Edge weights: Implicitly determined by distance and steering forces
- Graph updates automatically each frame as birds move

### 3. Temporal Processing
Temporal aspects are handled through:

1. Motion history tracking:
```python
class Bird:
    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float):
        self.history = []  # Store previous positions
        self.max_history = 10  # Temporal window size
    
    def update(self):
        # Update position history
        self.history.append(np.copy(self.position))
        if len(self.history) > self.max_history:
            self.history.pop(0)
```

2. Configuration parameters for temporal processing:
```python
@dataclass
class UCSConfig:
    temporal_window: float = 1.0  # Time window
    decay_rate: float = 0.1      # Decay constant
```

### 4. Force Integration
The system integrates multiple forces using biologically-inspired behaviors:

```python
def run(self):
    # ...
    # Calculate and integrate forces
    alignment = self.align(bird, neighbors)
    cohesion = self.cohesion(bird, neighbors)
    separation = self.separation(bird, neighbors)
    obstacle_avoidance = self.avoid_obstacles(bird)
    
    # Apply weighted forces
    bird.apply_force(alignment * 1.0)
    bird.apply_force(cohesion * 1.0)
    bird.apply_force(separation * 1.5)
    bird.apply_force(obstacle_avoidance * 2.0)
```

Each force represents a different type of interaction:

1. **Alignment Force** - Matches velocity with neighbors:
```python
def align(self, bird: Bird, neighbors: List[Bird]) -> np.ndarray:
    steering = np.zeros(2)
    if neighbors:
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            steering += neighbor.velocity
        steering = steering / len(neighbors)
        steering = (steering / np.linalg.norm(steering) * bird.max_speed 
                   if np.linalg.norm(steering) > 0 else steering)
        steering -= bird.velocity
    return np.clip(steering, -bird.max_force, bird.max_force)
```

2. **Cohesion Force** - Moves toward center of local group:
```python
def cohesion(self, bird: Bird, neighbors: List[Bird]) -> np.ndarray:
    steering = np.zeros(2)
    if neighbors:
        center = np.zeros(2)
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            center += neighbor.position
        center = center / len(neighbors)
        desired = center - bird.position
        if np.linalg.norm(desired) > 0:
            desired = desired / np.linalg.norm(desired) * bird.max_speed
        steering = desired - bird.velocity
    return np.clip(steering, -bird.max_force, bird.max_force)
```

3. **Separation Force** - Avoids crowding neighbors:
```python
def separation(self, bird: Bird, neighbors: List[Bird]) -> np.ndarray:
    steering = np.zeros(2)
    if neighbors:
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            diff = bird.position - neighbor.position
            dist = np.linalg.norm(diff)
            if dist > 0:
                diff = diff / dist / dist  # Weight by inverse square of distance
                steering += diff
    return np.clip(steering, -bird.max_force, bird.max_force)
```

### 5. Integration Cycle
The complete UCS cycle per frame:

1. Encode current state using HDC
2. Update dynamic graph (neighbor relationships)
3. Process temporal information (update history)
4. Calculate and integrate forces
5. Update positions and velocities
6. Render visual representation

This implementation demonstrates how UCS principles can be applied to create emergent flocking behavior through
 the integration of high-dimensional representations, dynamic relationships, and temporal processing. 
 The system shows robustness and adaptability, key features of the UCS framework.
