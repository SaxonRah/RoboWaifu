1. **Neural-HDC Encoder** (`NeuralHDCEncoder` class):
```python
class NeuralHDCEncoder:
    def __init__(self, hd_dimension: int):
        # Neural network weights for preprocessing
        self.W1 = np.random.randn(4, 16) / np.sqrt(4)
        self.W2 = np.random.randn(16, hd_dimension) / np.sqrt(16)
```
- Uses a two-layer neural network for preprocessing input features:
  - Power level
  - Generator status
  - Connection count
  - Power capacity
- Transforms these features into high-dimensional space (1000 dimensions)
- Applies tanh activation and normalization for stable representations

2. **Neural Temporal Processor** (`NeuralTemporalProcessor` class):
```python
class NeuralTemporalProcessor:
    def process(self, node_id: int, power_level: float) -> float:
        # Compute attention weights using softmax
        temporal_features = np.array(buffer + [power_level] * (self.buffer_size - len(buffer)))
        attention_weights = np.exp(temporal_features) / np.sum(np.exp(temporal_features))
```
- Maintains temporal buffer for each node
- Uses attention mechanism to weight historical power levels
- Attention weights are computed using softmax function
- Integrates temporal information with current power levels

3. **Hybrid Dynamic Graph** (`HybridDynamicGraph` class):
```python
class HybridDynamicGraph:
    def predict_edge(self, node1_features: np.ndarray, node2_features: np.ndarray) -> float:
        # Neural edge prediction
        combined_features = np.concatenate([node1_features, node2_features])
        hidden = np.maximum(0, combined_features @ self.W1)
        edge_score = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(hidden @ self.W2)))
```
- Uses neural network for edge prediction between nodes
- Takes encoded features from Neural-HDC as input
- Predicts connection strength between power nodes
- Updates grid topology based on predictions

4. **Integration in Smart Grid** (`SmartGrid` class):
```python
def update_power_flow(self):
    """Update power levels using neural temporal processing"""
    for node_id, node in self.nodes.items():
        if not node.is_generator:
            generators = [n for n in node.connections if self.nodes[n].is_generator]
            if generators:
                # Get power from generators
                power_received = sum(self.nodes[g].power_level for g in generators) / len(generators)
                
                # Apply temporal processing
                temporal_weight = self.temporal.process(node_id, node.power_level)
                power_received *= (0.7 + 0.3 * temporal_weight)
```

The components work together in the power distribution process:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Grid node states are encoded using Neural-HDC
   - Features include power levels, generator status, and connections
   - Neural preprocessing enhances feature representation

2. **Temporal Integration**:
   - Power flow history is maintained in temporal buffers
   - Attention mechanism identifies important temporal patterns
   - Weighted history influences current power distribution

3. **Graph Structure**:
   - Neural edge predictor determines optimal connections
   - Graph structure adapts based on power flow patterns
   - Connections are updated based on predicted edge scores

4. **Power Distribution**:
   - Power flows from generators to consumers through predicted connections
   - Flow rates are influenced by temporal patterns
   - Distribution adapts to changing power demands

Example Flow:
```
Generator Node -> Neural-HDC Encoding -> Graph Edge Prediction
                                    -> Temporal Processing
                                    -> Power Distribution
Consumer Node  -> Neural-HDC Encoding -> Temporal Processing
                                    -> Power Reception
```

This implements Hybrid UCS by:
- Using neural preprocessing in HDC encoding (Neural-HDC)
- Implementing attention-based temporal processing (Neural Temporal)
- Using neural networks for graph structure prediction (Hybrid Dynamic Graph)

The system demonstrates Hybrid UCS's advantages:
1. **Adaptability**: Grid structure adapts to power flow patterns
2. **Temporal Awareness**: Attention mechanisms capture usage patterns
3. **Robust Encoding**: Neural-HDC provides noise-resistant representations
4. **Efficient Distribution**: Neural edge prediction optimizes power flow
