**1. Neural HDC Encoder (NeuralHDCEncoder)**
```python
class NeuralHDCEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config: HybridConfig):
        # Neural preprocessing layers - improves raw input before encoding
        self.preprocessor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(config.input_dimension, config.nn_hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(config.nn_hidden_dim, config.input_dimension)
        )
        
        # HDC projection for high-dimensional encoding
        self.projection = torch.randn(config.input_dimension, config.hd_dimension)
        self.projection /= torch.norm(self.projection, dim=0)
```
This component:
- Takes robot state (x, y, velocity_x, velocity_y)
- Processes it through neural network layers
- Projects it into high-dimensional space (~1000D)
- Used to create robust state representations for each robot

**2. Neural Temporal Processor (NeuralTemporalProcessor)**
```python
class NeuralTemporalProcessor(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, t: float, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Maintains history of states
        self.time_buffer.append((t, x))
        
        # Neural attention weights for temporal samples
        if len(self.time_buffer) > 1:
            times, samples = zip(*self.time_buffer)
            samples_tensor = torch.stack(samples)
            attention_weights = self.attention(samples_tensor)
            weighted_result = (samples_tensor * attention_weights).mean(dim=0)
```
This component:
- Maintains a temporal buffer of robot states
- Uses neural attention to weight historical states
- Integrates past states with exponential decay
- Helps robots maintain smooth trajectories based on history

**3. Hybrid Dynamic Graph**
```python
class HybridDynamicGraph:
    def update_weights(self, features: Dict[int, torch.Tensor]) -> None:
        # Neural edge prediction
        combined = torch.cat([f_i, f_j])
        neural_weight = self.edge_predictor(combined.unsqueeze(0)).item()
        
        # Combine with traditional similarity
        sim = F.cosine_similarity(f_i.unsqueeze(0), f_j.unsqueeze(0)).item()
        hybrid_weight = alpha * sim + (1 - alpha) * neural_weight
```
This component:
- Maintains connections between robots
- Uses neural network to predict edge weights
- Combines neural predictions with cosine similarity
- Used for swarm coordination and collision avoidance

**4. Integration in Robot Class**
```python
class Robot:
    def process_state(self, t: float) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Get current state
        state = self.get_state_tensor()
        
        # HDC encoding
        hd_state = self.hdc_encoder(state.unsqueeze(0))
        
        # Temporal processing
        temporal_state = self.temporal_processor(t, hd_state)
```
Each robot:
- Encodes its state using Neural HDC
- Processes temporal information
- Uses this for movement decisions

**5. Swarm Coordination using Hybrid UCS**
```python
class SwarmSimulation:
    def update_graph(self):
        # Process states through complete Hybrid UCS pipeline
        features = {}
        for i, robot in enumerate(self.robots):
            state = robot.process_state(self.t)
            features[i] = state.squeeze()
            
        # Update graph weights using neural prediction
        self.graph.update_weights(features)
```
The swarm:
- Uses HDC-encoded states to represent each robot
- Updates graph structure using neural prediction
- Uses graph weights for collision avoidance:
```python
def update(self, target_x, target_y, neighbors, weights, dt):
    # Weight-based repulsion
    weight = weights[my_idx, i]
    repulsion_strength = (1 + weight) * (min_distance - dist) / min_distance * speed
```

This implementation differs from standard swarm algorithms by using the complete Hybrid UCS pipeline:
1. Neural preprocessing of robot states
2. High-dimensional encoding for robust representation
3. Temporal integration with attention
4. Neural graph updates for adaptive coordination
5. Combined traditional metrics (cosine similarity) with neural predictions

Each component from the reference implementation is used to make decisions about:
- How strongly robots should repel each other (graph weights)
- How to maintain formation (temporal processing)
- How to encode and process robot states (Neural HDC)
