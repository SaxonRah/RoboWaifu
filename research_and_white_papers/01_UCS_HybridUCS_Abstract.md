### Abstract: Unified Cognitive System (UCS)

The Unified Cognitive System (UCS) is a lightweight, modular framework designed to integrate hyperdimensional computing (HDC), dynamic graph structures, and temporal-spatial processing for robust cognitive tasks. UCS encodes low-dimensional data into high-dimensional representations using HDC, enabling noise-resilient and efficient feature encoding. Temporal processing incorporates a sliding time buffer with exponential decay, allowing for adaptive integration of time-series data. Dynamic graphs model evolving relationships between entities through cosine similarity-based edge updates, offering scalable graph representations. UCS is particularly suited for resource-constrained applications such as embedded robotics, where real-time adaptability and robustness are critical. While UCS lacks advanced learning and decision-making mechanisms, its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability make it an effective tool for tasks requiring noise-robust encoding, temporal integration, and lightweight dynamic graph modeling.

### Abstract: Hybrid Unified Cognitive System (Hybrid UCS)

The Hybrid Unified Cognitive System (Hybrid UCS) extends the capabilities of UCS by incorporating neural network components to enhance adaptability and learning. By combining the robustness of hyperdimensional computing (HDC) with the flexibility of neural networks, Hybrid UCS achieves a balance between computational efficiency and generalization. Neural preprocessing refines input data before HDC encoding, while a neural attention mechanism enhances temporal processing by dynamically weighting historical data. Additionally, a neural edge predictor refines graph-based relationships, augmenting UCS's static similarity metrics with learned interconnections. The Hybrid UCS framework is well-suited for robotics and dynamic systems, offering improved adaptability in moderately complex environments. While retaining UCS's efficiency, Hybrid UCS introduces basic learning capabilities, paving the way for future developments in transfer learning and human-robot interaction. However, the system's current implementation of neural components remains rudimentary, highlighting the need for further refinement to fully exploit its potential in complex cognitive and decision-making tasks.
