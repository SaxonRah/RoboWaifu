# Introduction

The increasing complexity of real-time cognitive systems, particularly in robotics and adaptive control, has created a need for architectures that balance computational efficiency with robust information processing. Traditional approaches often face challenges in managing the trade-off between processing power and adaptability, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces two complementary architectures: the Unified Cognitive System (UCS) and its neural-enhanced variant, Hybrid UCS.

The Unified Cognitive System (UCS) addresses these challenges through a novel integration of hyperdimensional computing (HDC), dynamic graph structures, and temporal-spatial processing. By leveraging HDC's inherent noise resistance and dimensionality reduction properties, UCS provides robust feature encoding while maintaining computational efficiency. The system's dynamic graph structure enables adaptive relationship modeling, while its temporal processing component handles time-series data through a principled decay mechanism. This combination makes UCS particularly suitable for embedded systems and real-time applications where reliability and efficiency are paramount.

Building on UCS's foundation, Hybrid UCS introduces neural network components to enhance the system's adaptability while preserving its core advantages. This hybrid architecture augments each major component of UCS: neural preprocessing enhances input encoding, attention mechanisms refine temporal processing, and neural edge prediction improves graph-based relationship modeling. The result is a system that maintains UCS's efficiency while introducing basic learning capabilities, achieved through a careful balance of traditional and neural processing (weighted at Î±=0.7 in the current implementation).

Our approach differs from existing cognitive architectures in several key aspects. While traditional systems often rely heavily on either symbolic processing or pure neural networks, UCS and Hybrid UCS demonstrate how these paradigms can be effectively combined. The base UCS system provides a lightweight, interpretable framework suitable for resource-constrained applications, while Hybrid UCS extends these capabilities to more complex, dynamic environments without sacrificing the core benefits of the original architecture.

This paper details the theoretical foundations, implementation considerations, and practical applications of both systems. We begin with a comprehensive overview of UCS's core components, followed by an examination of how Hybrid UCS enhances these components through neural integration. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both architectures across various tasks, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss future directions for research, including potential enhancements to both systems and their applications in emerging fields such as adaptive robotics and human-robot interaction.

Through this work, we aim to contribute to the development of more efficient and adaptable cognitive systems, particularly for applications where traditional approaches struggle to balance computational constraints with the need for robust, adaptive processing.
