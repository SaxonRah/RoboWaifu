Rigorous Mathematical Model of the UVC (Upper Body Vertical Control) approach.

1. Core UVC Principle Model:

The basic principle can be modeled as a feedback control system where:
```
θerror = θdesired - θactual
θdesired = 0 (vertical position)
```

For both sagittal (pitch) and frontal (roll) planes:
```
τhip = Kp * θerror + Ki * ∫θerror dt + Kd * (dθerror/dt)
```
where:
- τhip is the hip joint torque
- Kp, Ki, Kd are PID control gains

2. Extended Dynamic Model:

The robot's dynamics can be represented as:
```
M(q)q̈ + C(q,q̇)q̇ + G(q) = τ
```
where:
- M(q) is the inertia matrix
- C(q,q̇) represents Coriolis and centrifugal forces
- G(q) is the gravitational force vector
- τ is the joint torque vector
- q, q̇, q̈ are joint positions, velocities, and accelerations

3. UVC-Specific Hip Strategy:

For sagittal plane stabilization:
```
θhip_sagittal = arcsin(xCoM/l) + Kp_s * θpitch + Ki_s * ∫θpitch dt
```

For frontal plane stabilization:
```
θhip_frontal = arcsin(yCoM/l) + Kp_f * θroll + Ki_f * ∫θroll dt
```
where:
- xCoM, yCoM are the horizontal displacements of the Center of Mass
- l is the leg length
- θpitch, θroll are body orientation angles

4. Ground Reaction Force Model:

The contact forces can be modeled as:
```
F_GRF = Kground * δ + Bground * δ̇
```
where:
- Kground is ground stiffness
- Bground is ground damping
- δ is ground penetration depth
- δ̇ is penetration velocity

5. Stride Length Adaptation:

Based on the code, stride length modification can be modeled as:
```
Stride = Sbase + KUVC * ∫θpitch dt
```
where:
- Sbase is the base stride length
- KUVC is the UVC gain factor

6. Stability Criterion:

For stable walking, we need:
```
ZMP = xCoM + ẍCoM * (zCoM/g) ∈ Support_Polygon
```
where:
- ZMP is the Zero Moment Point
- zCoM is the CoM height
- g is gravitational acceleration

7. Enhanced Angular Momentum Control:

Total angular momentum regulation:
```
Ḣ = ∑(ri × Fi) + ∑τi = 0
```
where:
- H is angular momentum
- ri are position vectors
- Fi are forces
- τi are torques

8. Integrated UVC Model:

Combining these components:
```
τUVC = JT * [KP * (qd - q) + KD * (q̇d - q̇)] + G(q)
```
where:
- J is the Jacobian matrix
- qd, q̇d are desired positions and velocities
- KP, KD are gain matrices

9. State Transition Model:

For walking phase transitions:
```
P(s' | s, a) = f(θbody, θ̇body, FGR, phase)
```
where:
- s is current state
- a is action
- FGR is ground reaction force
- phase is walking phase

10. Implementation Recommendations:

1. Real-time State Estimation:
```python
def estimate_state(sensors):
    θ = get_imu_orientation()
    θ̇ = get_imu_angular_velocity()
    F = get_force_sensors()
    return State(θ, θ̇, F)
```

2. UVC Control Loop:
```python
def uvc_control(state):
    θerror = calculate_orientation_error(state)
    τhip = compute_hip_torque(θerror)
    return apply_torque_limits(τhip)
```

3. Adaptive Gain Tuning:
```python
def adapt_gains(performance_metrics):
    Kp = update_proportional_gain(metrics)
    Ki = update_integral_gain(metrics)
    Kd = update_derivative_gain(metrics)
    return Gains(Kp, Ki, Kd)
```

This mathematical model provides a more rigorous foundation for UVC. Key improvements over the original implementation include:

1. Explicit modeling of dynamics and forces
2. Integration of angular momentum control
3. Consideration of ground reaction forces
4. State-space representation of the system
5. Adaptive gain tuning capabilities

To validate this model:

1. Implement in simulation software (like ODE)
2. Compare performance with original implementation
3. Test robustness to disturbances
4. Analyze stability bounds
5. Measure energy efficiency
